<p>Very often, it happens that I have an idea for a sketch, that seems relatively simple to implement, however, when the time comes and I'm free to start working on it, I have literally no clue where to even begin. This is usually because I underestimated the complexity of the problem at hand. 
For example, recently I've stumbled across a number of P5JS and Processing sketches, that try to fit as many simple shapes as possible, where each shape has a different size, into an area of limited size. This is usually called packing, or more comonly known as packing problems.</p>

<p>A little bit further down the rabbit hole, I find out that packing problems are actually actually a quite difficult family of mathematical optimization problems. This doesn't discourage me however, but rather makes the problem even more exciting as well as challenging.</p>

<h2>Why is Rectangle Packing so difficult</h2>

<p>Optimization problems are generally not my cup of tea, and even though I had to take some courses on alorithmic complexity during my bachelor years, this is usually way over my head. But I found a number of interesting papers on the topic, one of them was very old: "The bottom-left bin-packing heuristic: An efficient Implementation" from 1983 by Bernard Chazelle. And I have a weak spot for old papers, especially when they have figures that must have taken a lot of effort to make back then. I found it through this heated stackoverflow thread that was also inquiring about a solution for this problem.</p>

<h2> Existing algorithms </h2>

<h2> Not reinventing the wheel </h2>
<p>After staring at my laptop screen for more than two hours with frustration, trying to implement some simple version of a greedy heuristic algorithm that will neatly pack my rectangles, I ultimately gave up and started looking for already implemented algorithms.</p>
