Gifs are cool, but making them can be tricky. In the past 2 years I've had to make a lot of powerpoint presentations for university presentations, and I've always wanted to make them the best they could possible be, aesthetically and information wise. And what's better than having a lot of cool images and graphs in your presentation? Visualizing processes with animated gifs. Since the focus of my studies were neural networks which involved training them, I would most often want to visualize this learning process by drawing a sample output from my model at every learning iteration (epoch), which in turn would allow me to qualitatively assess how well it was performing. This usually made me end up with a folder on my desktop that held hundreds to thousands of images.
