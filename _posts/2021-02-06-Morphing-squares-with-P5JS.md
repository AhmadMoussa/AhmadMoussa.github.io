<p>This time around we're going to look at how to create continuous motion in our animation. In this case the sine function is our best friend. I remember studying trigonometric functions in school, and having the worst time of my life. I didn't get them, I hated them and they had no practical purpose for me in real life. But it's kind of funny that I've come around to loving them, almost eight years after having been introduced to them for the first time.</p>

<p>In mathematics the Sine function of an angle is defined as the ratio of the opposite side of an angle to it's hypotenuse. And it's exactly this definition that I hated so much in school. It doesn't really show you all the wonderful things that you can do with the Sine function, it's just a bland non-descriptive book definition. In the next part I'll explain why the Sine function is so great and how I like to think about it.</p>

<h3>The Sine function is a conversion of linear motion into oscillating motion</h3>
<p>The Sine function has two awesome properties. Firstly it is bounded by the interval [-1,1] and secondly we can use it to convert a linear movement into an oscillating movement. You'll get what I mean with this in a second.</p>
