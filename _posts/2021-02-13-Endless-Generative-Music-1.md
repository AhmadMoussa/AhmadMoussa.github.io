<h3>The Origins of Generative Music</h3>
Generative Music finds it's beginnings with Brian Eno, an English musician and record producer, who first got interested in Generative Music by observing wind chimes, and how they could endlessly create different sounds, without ever repeating themselves. In a way, they are incapable of creating the same sound twice. This sparked in him the idea of creating a system that was capable of continuously generating a stream of music that kept changing. His first experiments involved playing around with tape recorders, that would play melodic parts he pre-recorded, which would musically work together when played at the same time. Playing these tape recorder at modulating speeds and different offsets made it such that an entirely new musical piece emerged that never repeated itself.
