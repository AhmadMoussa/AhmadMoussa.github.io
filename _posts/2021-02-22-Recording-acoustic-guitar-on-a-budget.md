<h2>No microphone? Just use your smart phone!</h2>
I'll asume that you live in the 21st century and have a smart phone, and I don't mean that you need one of the latest models that's on the market out there, a 2 to 5 year old phone will do. For the examples in this blog post I'm using a Samsung A70 that I've had for a while now.

<h3>Smart Phones can make decent recordings</h3>
With social media platforms like TikTok being insanely popular these days, there is still a demand for phones that are capable of decent quality audio recording. It's impossible to say what manufacturers and the operating system developers of specific brands put inside your phone, but it's safe to say that they will attempt to top off your device with the best possible recording possibilities. Equivalently, machine learning algorithms are not only finding their way into automatically enhancing the selfies that you're taking, but also the recordings that you're making with your phone.

<h3>Positioning is key</h3>

<h3>The room you're in matters</h3>


<h2>Getting the recording from your phone into your pc</h2>

<h3>Online converters or FFMPEG</h3>
It can happen that your phone can only take recordings in a format that is not supported by your DAW. For example, my Samsung creates recordings that are in the .m4a format, which can not be recognized by Ableton Live. Usually you'll want to have your recording in a .wav or .mp3 format, which you can simply drag and drop into Ableton. For converting your audio files there's two ways:

<h3>The easy way: Online Converter</h3>

<h3>The hard way: FFMPEG</h3>

<h2> Free VST's to process your audio recording</h2>

<h3>Compression... Lots of compression</h3>

<h3>EQ and Filtering</h3>

<h3>Reverbbbbbbbbb</h3>
