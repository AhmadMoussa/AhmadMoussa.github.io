To get straight to the point, things you'll need to get started with minting on the Tezos blockchain via hicetnunc.xyz are:

- A tezos wallet
- Some tezos

## Tezos Wallets
There's many different wallets all with their pros and cons, personally I use the Temple Wallet which is supported by hicetnunc, convenient and exists as a Google Chrome extension. Once you install the extension, you'll have to create a wallet, it'll ask you to set up a seed phrase and store it somewhere secure so you remember it later. This is very important.

Once you have your wallet set up, you're ready to receive Tezos in it. You can either set up an account on an exchange site like coinbase and binance, exchange some fiat currency for Tezos and then send them to yourself, or have someone who already has some Tezos send some to you. Where the easier option is the latter. Eventually you'll have to set up an axchange account anyway to trade it in for real money.

## Hicetnunc.xyz

If you're ready to mint your first #CleanNFT and you have at least 0.08 XTZ in your wallet, then you're good to go. Head over to hicetnunc.xyz, click the drop down icon in the top right corner and click 'mint OBJKTs'. It'll take you to a page where you have to fill out some details about the NFT you want to mint. Fill out the the first three fields with the OBJKT's name, a brief description about the NFT (also make sure to include your Twitter handle in this description such that potential buyers can verify you're the original creator), and lastely some tags relevant to the NFT (they don't do anything just yet, but will probably help in the future for organizing the content on the website).

Lastly you have to specify how many editions you want to have of the minted OBJKT. Depending on how rare you want to have your NFT, then you should specify a lower number. This will also determine how much it will cost to mint the OBJKT, each edition you mint costs 0.08 XTZ. So minting 3 editions of your OBJKT will cost you 0.24 XTZ. Keep that in mind.

Now hit the 'mint' button. It'll notify that you have to 'sync' first, with a pop up window. Hit 'sync' in the upper right corner, grant permission with your wallet, then try pressing mint again. It'll ask you for another notification from your wallet to execute the transaction. The Temple wallet should show you sccuess message in the top right corner, or something else if something goes wrong. If everything went well it should have minted your NFT.

## Managing and curating your assets

After minting your OBJKT wait 2-3 minutes then click the drop down menu again, and click 'manage assets'. Your wallet is going to ask for permission. Now it should show you a page that contains your OBJKT with a number. Click on your OBJKT, and it should take to a page that is displaying your OBJKT in all it's glory with the information you've entered earlier below it. Your NFT is minted, but you still have to offer it up for purchase. Hit 'sync', and some new buttons should show u next to 'info' and 'owners'. Click on the 'curate' button (it could also have a different name like 'swap', depending on what the devs decide to call it). It'll make two fields apear underneath it 'objkt amount' and 'price per objkt (in tez)'. The first field will specify how many of the OBJKTs you minted you want to offer up for auction
