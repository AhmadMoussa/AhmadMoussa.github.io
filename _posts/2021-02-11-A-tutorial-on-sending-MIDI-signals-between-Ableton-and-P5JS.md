In one of my earlier blog posts I explain how one can communicate MIDI signals between a python script and ableton live. In this blog plost we'll have a look at how we can send MIDI signals from Ableton to P5JS, which will allow us to control our animated sketches with MIDI signals. This time around we'll also need the LoopMIDI virtual port that we have used for the python tutorial, so go ahead and download it from <a href='http://www.tobias-erichsen.de/software/loopmidi.html' target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">here</a>.

Next we'll hop over to the web editor.
