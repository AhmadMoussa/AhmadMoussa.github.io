<h2>Conception</h2>
In September 2019, for the second semester of my Master studies, I signed up for a course called 'Computer Graphics Optimization'. Which sounded interesting to me, since I had taken a course on computer graphics before, where I learned to use OpenGL and implement many computer graphics concepts such as ray-tracing, creating meshes and a lot about the camera object and how illumination is simulated. However, I wasn't ready for this course. Very quickly I found myself knee-deep in convex optimization and trying to understand what the heck a Lagrangian was, among other topics that went way over my head. Ultimately I did pass by the skin of my teeth, the professor being kind enough to adhere to the practice exam that uploaded prior to the actual final. 

The important part of the story is the course project that we were assigned. Not knowing anyone in the class I opted to do it individually. One of the topics that was covered in the class, were neural networks, since they're inherently massive optimization problems. And because I was playing a lot of Celeste at the time, I decided to write in my project proposal, that I wanted to generate pixel art with GANs and/or a mixture of CycleGAN. And you can probably guess, that I've bitten off more than I could chew.
